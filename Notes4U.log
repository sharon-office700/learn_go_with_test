Discipline

Let's go over the cycle again

    Write a test

    Make the compiler pass

    Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful

    Write enough code to make the test pass

    Refactor

On the face of it this may seem tedious but sticking to the feedback loop is important.

Not only does it ensure that you have relevant tests, it helps ensure you design good software by refactoring with the safety of tests.
